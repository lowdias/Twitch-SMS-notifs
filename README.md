# Twitch-SMS-notifs
This script checks if a specific Twitch channel is live and sends an SMS notification using Twilio if it is.
Make sure to replace the placeholders (in all-caps) with your own values. You can also modify the message that is sent in the SMS body to include more information if desired. Once you've set everything up, you can run this code periodically (e.g., every minute) using a cron job or similar scheduling mechanism to check if your Twitch channel is live and receive SMS notifications in real time.
